# Assignment 3 by Tommaso Framba and Chris Toujmaki

In this third assignment implementations are included for two neural network models 
with SimpleRNN and LSTM layers respectively, as well as implementations for 
decoding the Viterbi algorithm. 

## Usage

In order to run the SimpleRNN neural network open the asg3_1_SimpleRNN.py file and press run.
In order to run the LSTM neural network open the asg3_1_LSTM.py file and press run. 
In order to run the viterbi decoding algorithm open the asg3_3_Viterbi.py file and press run.
